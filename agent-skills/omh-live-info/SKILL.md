# Live Info Operator

This is an OMH `live-info-operator` workflow skill, projected for Agent Skills hosts (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode, OpenClaw, pi).

## Why This Exists

`live-info-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and get a structured, checkable answer instead of an improvised one.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: live-info-operator check today's Seoul weather with freshness, units, and provider boundaries before answering.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_live_info_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: live-info-operator invent the latest stock price without provider evidence or timestamp.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Domain, location or symbol, time window, provider preference, freshness, units, and stop condition are explicit.
- Provider setup, API access, source quality, stale data, and missing location/symbol decisions are gated or marked missing.
- Weather, price, score, exchange-rate, time-zone, map, place, and traffic facts are reported only from observed provider evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the provider, plugin, API key, or connector is missing, route to toolbelt-readiness before preparing result claims.
- If the request asks for citations, best practices, docs, or broad current-source synthesis, route to research instead.
- If the request would create, update, invite, send, or mutate external provider state, route to connector-operator instead.



## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise read-only live information lookups without claiming provider availability, API access, freshness, retrieval, or result correctness.

    Strong routing signals: `live-info-operator`, `live info operator`, `live information`, `real time information`, `real-time information`, `weather today`, `current weather`, `weather forecast`, `stock price`, `crypto price`, `btc price`, `exchange rate`, `sports score`, `game score`, `time zone`, `timezone`, `time in`, `map directions`, `directions to`, `near me`, `nearby restaurants`, `traffic now`, `오늘 날씨`, `현재 날씨`, `날씨 예보`, `주가`, `코인 가격`, `환율`, `스포츠 점수`, `경기 결과`, `시간대`, `현재 시간`, `지도`, `길찾기`, `주변 식당`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `live-info`
Phase: `live-info-task`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- live_info_task_card/v1
- live_info_scope/v1
- freshness_boundary/v1
- live_info_result_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- live_info_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- live_info_scope/v1 with domain, location or symbol, time window, provider preference, units, and stop condition
- freshness_boundary/v1 separating requested recency, provider timestamp, source quality, and stale-result handling
- live_info_result_manifest/v1 only when provider response, timestamp, quote/source id, or rendered result is observed

Safety rules:

- A live information card is not provider availability, API access, live data retrieval, weather, market price, sports score, exchange-rate, time-zone, map, or place-result evidence unless observed live-info result evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Use the current host's own tools and subagent/task mechanism when available;
otherwise run the same lanes sequentially or name the unavailable capability.
A prepared plan, handoff, checklist, or skill installation is not execution,
review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence. Record actual tool results, or
`not_observed` / `not_available`, in the record; never invent dispatch or host
accounting.
Treat supplied context as advisory, not proof of hidden memory reads or writes.
State scope, constraints, verification, and the stop condition before work.
Reply in the user's own words and the host's own voice: OMH's record terms
(surface, lane, wrapper, handoff, evidence boundary, not_observed) stay in
records and tool calls, never in the sentence the user reads unless they ask
about one; and when a stop condition or a decision the user owns ends the turn,
offer the next action as a question rather than declaring what will not be done.
Supporting paths are relative to this skill directory; sibling skill paths are
relative to its parent. Resolve them from the host-provided skill base directory
(`{baseDir}` on hosts that provide it), never a hardcoded install location.
A named workflow not installed here is unavailable, not permission to emulate
its host-specific capabilities. Verify through the real surface before done.
