"""Project the lexical shortlist index into a sidecar the plugin bundle can read.

The per-turn hook that could use `lexical_shortlist.lexical_ranking` runs
inside Hermes, from the plugin bundle, and the bundle cannot import `omh`
(`tests/test_plugin_bundle_standalone.py`). So the index is written out as
data: every skill's term weights, its anchor words, the stopwords, the
stemmer's exception words, and the BM25 constants -- and, for Korean, the
syllable bigrams of every skill's existing Hangul triggers
(`lexical_shortlist.hangul_terms`), their anchors, and the Hangul filler. The stemmer's rules are
code, so the bundle repeats them and the parity test holds the two equal. The bundle's reader
(`src/plugin_bundle/omh/skill_shortlist.py`) rebuilds the ranking from this
file alone and holds no vocabulary of its own.

`omh docs skill-shortlist` writes it, `--check` fails when it drifts from the
catalog, and `tests/test_skill_shortlist_sidecar.py` holds the bundle's
ranking equal to this module's source over a fixed message set.
