"""Does a scored winner carry enough evidence of its own to dispatch?

Shortlist first. `_confidence` calls a score of 8 `high`, and a high winner
used to dispatch. Eight is three everyday words: a trigger phrase is also
credited through each of its tokens, so a sentence that merely contains
`before` and `merge` reached `verification-gate`. A dispatch on that evidence
throws away what the router does better on such a message: a shortlist that
names the right skill. (On the in-sample tuning set, BM25's top four held the
intended skill for most English messages where a token-scored winner often
did not; that is a tuning-set observation, not a held-out claim.)

So a confident winner dispatches only on strong evidence, and every other
winner becomes a clarify that carries the shortlist for Hermes to choose from.
This module does not change a score, a confidence, or an ordering. It reads
the winner's matched labels -- the record of why it scored -- and classifies
them. The caller dispatches on every class except `weak`.

Strong evidence:

- an explicit invocation, the skill's rendered label named in the message
  (`ulw-context`, `omh-code-review`), a `direct:` predicate, or a `domain:`
  signal;
- any label the generic scorer does not produce (a fast path decided it);
- the winner's own multi-word, hyphenated, or sigilled trigger phrase
  (`code review`, `ulw-context`, `$ulw`), or its multi-word name, unless
  another scored skill said as many phrases of its own and the winner's own
  evidence does not lead it by `PHRASE_LEAD` -- two even phrases are a
  choice, not a decision;
- a trusted intent guard: one that matches an intent shape and, where it was
  measured deciding dispatches, was right at least three times for every
  wrong. The table is `GUARD_DISPATCH_TRUST` in `routing/policy.py`;
- non-ASCII input, which the Routing Language Policy leaves to the frozen
  trigger tables and to model selection rather than to an English-word gate.

Weak evidence, which clarifies: trigger tokens however many or rare, a single
word of the skill's name, description words, and a context-only guard, which
fires on co-occurring topic words rather than an intent shape.
